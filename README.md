# CLARIFION APP 
React + Tailwind


## Below, I outline the process followed to develop the upsell application according to the provided specifications:

- 1. Review of the Design in Figma:

I started by reviewing the design provided in Figma to fully understand the expected structure, style, and functionality. I paid special attention to design details to ensure the implementation was pixel perfect.

- 2. Development Environment Setup:

I set up my development environment using React.js and Tailwind. These technologies were selected due to their ability to offer complete interface customization and ease of future scalability.

- 3. User Interface (UI) Implementation:

I recreated the user interface exactly as shown in the Figma design. I used Tailwind to apply styles efficiently and maintain visual consistency.

- 4. Mobile Responsiveness (Responsive Design):

I ensured that the application was fully responsive, verifying that the design adapted perfectly to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop devices. I utilized Tailwind's utilities to adjust the design to various resolutions.

- 5. Testing and Validation:

I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all functionalities and the design matched the Figma specifications exactly. I tested the application on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.

- 6. Deployment:

I deployed the application on Vercel, generating a public link accessible from any device. This facilitates review and additional testing by the team.
